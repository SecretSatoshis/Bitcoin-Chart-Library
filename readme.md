# Bitcoin Chart Library

Welcome to the Secret Satoshis Bitcoin Chart Library, an automated system for visualizing Bitcoin data. This project leverages Python to generate dynamic and informative Bitcoin charts, using Plotly for interactive visualization and Dash to build a seamless web interface.

## Project Overview

The Bitcoin Chart Library is designed to provide an analysis and visualization tool for Bitcoin data. It automates data fetching, processing, and chart generation, making it a valuable resource for financial analysts, traders, and enthusiasts who want a clear understanding of Bitcoin's market trends.

The charts generated by this library are used on [SecretSatoshis.com](https://secretsatoshis.com) and in the [Secret Satoshis newsletter](https://www.newsletter.secretsatoshis.com/), providing insights and data visualization to support the content of the newsletter. This GitHub repository powers the analytics and visualizations featured in the newsletter.

Users can also access the charts saved in PNG format in the `chart_images` folder or in live HTML format in the `charts` folder at any time in the repository or saved locally.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Integration**: Fetches Bitcoin-related data from multiple sources, including on-chain metrics, financial data, and market prices, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
- **Custom Analysis**: Performs in-depth custom analyses, applying various data transformations and calculations to provide insights into Bitcoin's market behavior.
- **Interactive Charting**: Utilizes Plotly to create clear, interactive charts, enabling detailed exploration of the data.
- **Dynamic Web Interface**: Built with Dash to deliver a flexible, responsive web application that organizes and displays charts in an easy-to-navigate layout.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of the following key components:

- **data_format.py**: Fetches, cleans, and processes Bitcoin data from various sources, ensuring the data is ready for analysis.
- **data_definitions.py**: Defines data sources, financial tickers, and key parameters used throughout the project.
- **chart_format.py**: Configures the appearance and layout of the generated charts.
- **dash_app.py**: Manages the Dash web application's structure, rendering charts dynamically.
- **main.py**: The main script that integrates all components, executing the process of fetching data, performing analysis, and generating the charts.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SecretSatoshis/bitcoin-chart-library.git
   cd bitcoin-chart-library
   ```

   ```

By default, the app is accessible locally:
   - [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080)

## Automated Updates

The Bitcoin Chart Library employs GitHub Actions to automate daily updates. The workflow fetches new data, recalculates metrics, and generates updated charts at 16:00 UTC each day, ensuring the application remains up-to-date with the latest market information. 

## Data Sources

The Bitcoin Chart Library integrates data from various reliable sources, including:

- **[CoinMetrics](https://coinmetrics.io/)**: On-chain metrics and historical Bitcoin data.
- **[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)**: Financial data for stocks, commodities, and indices.
- **[Alternative.me](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)**: Fear and Greed Index data for sentiment analysis.
